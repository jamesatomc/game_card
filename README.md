To run a Flutter application, follow these steps:

1. **Open Terminal or Command Prompt**: Access your terminal or command prompt. On Windows, you can do this by searching for `cmd` in the Start menu.

2. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**: Use the `cd` command to change directories to your Flutter project's root directory. For example:
   ```plaintext
   cd path/to/your/flutter_project
   ```

3. **Ensure Devices are Connected**: Make sure your target device (emulator or physical device) is connected and recognized by Flutter. You can check connected devices by running:
   ```plaintext
   flutter devices
   ```

4. **Run the Flutter Application**: Execute the following command to run your Flutter application:
   ```plaintext
   flutter run
   ```
   This command compiles your app and installs it on the currently selected device.

5. **Hot Reload**: Once your app is running, you can make changes to your code and see them immediately reflected in the app through Hot Reload. Simply save your changes and press `r` in the terminal where your app is running. To perform a hot restart, which resets the state of the app, press `R`.

Remember, before running a Flutter application, ensure you have Flutter installed and properly set up on your system. You can verify your Flutter setup by running `flutter doctor` in the terminal, which checks your environment and displays a report to the terminal window.
